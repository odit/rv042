# Script to create/delete 6to4 tunnels.
# written by Olaf Titz, 2004-06-12. Public domain.
#
# This creates a standard 6to4 tunnel. With this tunnel, everyone with an
# IPv4 connection can give their network full IPv6 connectivity without
# the need for further configuration.
# In case of a dynamically assigned IPv4 address, this creates a dynamic,
# but fully functional, IPv6 network prefix.
# See RFC 3056, RFC 3068.
#
# Requires Linux 2.6 and an appropriate version of iproute; radvd recommended.
#
# Assume your IPv4 address (e.g. the local end of your PPP connection) is
# 1.2.3.4, the tunnel is created from 2002:0102:0304::1 to ::192.88.99.1.
# Also the local network is assigned the address 2002:0102:0304::/48 and
# the IPv6 default route is set into the tunnel. (Where "default" currently
# means 2000::/3, which includes all assigned global unicast addresses.)
# The kernel routing handles the 2002::/16 prefix specially as defined
# in RFC 3056. The remote address is a globally assigned anycast
# address for tunneling; there are routers all over the world which
# handle this transparently.
# (If you happen to have a dedicated IPv6 tunnel router change the REMOTE
# addresses below.)
#
# This script can be called from /etc/ppp/ip-up like:
#   6to4 up "$4" eth0
# and likewise from /etc/ppp/ip-down:
#   6to4 down "$4" eth0
# Substitute the local ethernet interface for eth0 as needed.
#
# To announce the 6to4 network prefix and default route into your local
# network, use the following radvd.conf:
#   interface eth0 { 
#        AdvSendAdvert on;
#        MinRtrAdvInterval 20; 
#        MaxRtrAdvInterval 60;
#        AdvLinkMTU 1400; # adapt as needed
#        prefix 2002::/64 { 
#                AdvOnLink off; 
#                AdvAutonomous on; 
#                AdvRouterAddr on; 
#                Base6to4Interface tun64; # note this!
#                AdvPreferredLifetime 90;
#                AdvValidLifetime 120;
#        };
#   };
# The trick here is that we assign the local IPv4 address (redundantly)
# to the tunnel interface, so radvd picks it from the tunnel instead of
# the PPP device. So radvd announces the tunnel only when it's really up.
